Facebook Image Graph Search : 
Facebook's new Post Search is a bummer for people like me. The searching (stalking) of pictures of friends (friend's friend) is a difficult task now because it does not show the graph searched results of the public photos directly. 
I needed to find a way out . I tried searching for old graph searched links from history. Luckily they are still working. 
Now the problem statement was to find the graph searched images result given a username . To get the results we need to form a new url which required the profile id. Scraping the facebook profile id is easy using a query at facebook graph. Once we get the id we can form the url and open it out .
