<h1>Facebook Image Graph Search</h1> : 
Facebook's new Post Search is a bummer for people who like stalking. The searching of pictures of friends (friend's friend) is a difficult task now because it does not show the graph searched results of the public photos directly. Using  graph search api and angularjs I solved the problem. Check the demo.
